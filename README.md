# Project Indigo

Google has an open-source project named Magenta that enables users to generate new music through machine learning models. We want to leverage this project to build a platform for artists and music enthusiasts to easily create new forms of music through machine learning. 
Our web application will have a user interface that allows users to dictate the style of music they want to create by uploading their own music files. The app uses the Magenta platform to interpolate between them and produce a new sample. It can also generate drum tracks to accompany a music file.
